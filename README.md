# COBS-CPP
An Arduino compatible COBS (Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing) Encoder/Decoder.

This library was taken from Patrick Baus and modified so that it can be used in a project. In this project the Arduino IDE had problems with the unitests and beacuse of this they were removed. Asides from that nothing was changed.
